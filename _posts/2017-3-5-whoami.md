## Personal Details
I am a software engineer currently working and residing inside of Bellevue, WA. Right now I am happily 
employed at Salesforce (CRM) - and previously have worked at a number of startups as both a FTE and contractor.

Although I was originally born and raised in Bozeman, MT - I always had a strong aptitude for technology which
drove me to migrate west in search of new and exciting opportunities.
