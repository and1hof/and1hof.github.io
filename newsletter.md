Want to keep up to date with the latest in application security, software engineering 
and other interesting topics?

My once-per month no-spam email list is the best way to do that as it's manually curated, contains info on hard to find but interesting topics as well as interviews
with top pen testers, engineers, architects and people working on cool upcoming technology.

Try it, and if you don't like it you can unsubscribe at anytime - no hard feelings :)
