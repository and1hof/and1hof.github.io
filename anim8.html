<h1>Anim8 has Shut Down</h1>

Anim8 was a video hosting and discovery site for animators and animation fans.
<br/>
Anim8 operated from 2016 until 2021 and served over 3 million users.
<br/>
Although Anim8 was popular and had a large, friendly community - it lost money every year 
and was funded largely from staff donations.
<br/>
In order to operate for another year, Anim8 would have had to find thousands of dollars to 
keep the website running. As a result, the staff decided that perhaps it was time to move onto 
other projects rather than dip into staff savings again.
