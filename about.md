### Personal Details
I am a **security architect** working and residing inside of Seattle, WA.

Currently I am happily employed at [Coinbase](https://www.coinbase.com) ([COIN](http://www.marketwatch.com/investing/stock/coin)) where I am the security lead for multiple user-facing products such as Ethereum Staking, Coinbase Web App, Coinbase Mobile App and Coinbase Card.

Previously I worked at [Salesforce](https://www.salesforce.com) ([CRM](http://www.marketwatch.com/investing/stock/crm)) where I was the security lead for 13 teams in Lightning Platform - a department specializing in JavaScript / DOM / NodeJS development.

Prior to working at Salesforce I worked at a number of startups as a software engineer, both as a FTE and contractor.

Although I was originally born and raised in Bozeman, MT - I always had a strong aptitude for technology which drove me to migrate west in search of new and exciting opportunities.

### Skills & Technologies
I am a big advocate of **full-stack JavaScript** as developing applications in a single language dramatically reduces context switching penalties and with smart architecture can reduce dependency management difficulty as well.

At serveral points in my career I have worked with **TC39** - the technical architecture committee under **ECMA International** (creators and maintainers of the JavaScript programming language). Most of my efforts with this have been towards architecting next gen JavaScript security features like **[Realms](https://github.com/tc39/proposal-realms)**. Some of my contributions have been folded into **[LavaMoat](https://github.com/LavaMoat/LavaMoat)** which is now the most popular open source supply chain attack mitigation tool.

I also wrote a security book that outlines the latest archetypes of vulnerabilities found in JavaScript-based web applications. You can find my book **Web Application Security: Exploitation and Countermeasures** [here](https://amzn.to/3g8LNvT).

I've read the entire [TC39 ECMA-262 standard](https://www.ecma-international.org/ecma-262/11.0/index.html#title), including contributing some undocumented features around language intrinsics. 

Beyond JavaScript, I have worked in **C#** and **Java** at professionally. 

My favorite language outside of JavaScript however is **C**, as I prefer using either high or low level languages and find the inbetween languages frustrating. 

### Hobbies
I enjoy **reading**, **writing**, **meditation**, **kayaking**, **hiking**, **gardening** and other peaceful activities that help me relax. I find that I obsess over work at times and need to cool down and recharge. Re-connecting with nature through gardening and outdoor activies has been really helpful in that regard.
